## Overview

This study investigates how patent citation patterns evolve over time by incorporating dynamic environmental factors from the technology fields to which each patent belongs.
Traditional studies often focus on static patent attributes, but this research introduces an evolutionary perspective — showing that the technological impact of patents is shaped by changing field conditions.

## Methodology
	•	Model: Cox proportional hazard model (accounts for right-censoring & inter-citation times)
	•	Data: 65,960 U.S. patents (USPTO, 1995–2014) in Information Technology (IT) and Healthcare sectors
	•	Key Dynamic Variables:
	1.	Technology Cycle Time (TCT) — speed of technological progress
	2.	Technological Convergence Potential — connectivity across fields (IPC co-occurrence network)
	3.	Field Popularity — intensity of innovation activity in a domain
	4.	Technological Novelty — uniqueness of knowledge recombination (z-score method)

⸻

## Key Findings
	•	The evolution of technology fields significantly alters forward citation dynamics.
	•	Rapidly evolving fields (short TCT) show earlier but fewer peak citations.
	•	High convergence potential fields sustain citations longer and at higher rates.
	•	Technological novelty shows a non-linear effect — extreme novelty often reduces citations except in hybrid/conventional areas.
	•	Cross-industry patents (IT–Healthcare) display distinct citation lifecycles compared to within-industry patents.

⸻

## Contributions
	•	Introduces a dynamic, evolutionary model for patent impact prediction.
	•	Offers scenario analyses to forecast how changes in field evolution affect future citations.
	•	Provides insights for R&D strategy, innovation policy, and technology investment decisions.
